These lectures and hands-on exercises are a part of the training curriculum from
the OHBM 2018 training course ran by [ReproNim](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org)
(Reproducible Neuroimaging) Center.  Selected materials are taylored for
this course and covers only some sections within the full, but relatively short, event schedule.
Please visit [ReproNim: Teach](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org) for
more materials, which also will be referenced within specific lessons here.


### Introduction

The term "reproducibility" conjures a mental image of dedicated systems
conducting automated and repeatable computations.  However, **you** can
embrace reproducibility as a principle to apply to your day-to-day
research activities.  Neuroimaging is a heavily data and software driven
field of science.  As a result, by learning more tricks and techniques
of the tools that you already use daily, you will discover ways to
not only improve efficiency but also increase the reproducibility of
your research.

To some degree, reproducibility requires knowledge of **what**, **when**,
and **how** any particular analysis was carried out. Therefore the
lessons in this module will focus on helping to answer those questions,
while going from how "black box" shell could provide you valuable record
of your activities, over to use of complete computational environments
where versioning and origin information about each component is either
exactly prescribed or just could be identified, and then to entire (simple
but complete) data analysis from raw data while maintaining a complete
and unambiguous provenance of all actions and access to **all**
components of the study (code, data, computational environments).
