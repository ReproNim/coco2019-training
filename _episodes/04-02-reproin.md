## Introduction

In this lesson, we will carry out a full (although very basic) functional
imaging study, going from raw data to complete data-analysis results.  We will
start from imaging data in DICOM format â€” as if we had just finished scanning.
Importantly, we will conduct this analysis so that it

- leaves a comprehensive "paper trail" of all performed steps; everything
  will be tracked via version control

- structures components in a way that facilitates reuse

- performs all critical computation in containerized computational environments
  for improved reproducibility and portability

The following sections highlight a few core concepts that are instrumental for
achieving these goals. For all steps of this study, we will use [DataLad] to
achieve these goals with relatively minimal effort.

> #### DataLad Extensions
>
> [DataLad] itself is a data management package that is completely agnostic of
> data formats and analysis procedures. However, DataLad functionality can be
> extended via so-called *extension packages* that add additional support for
> particular data formats and workflows. In this lesson, we will make use
> of two extension packages: [datalad-neuroimaging] and [datalad-container].

### Joint Management of Data, Code, and Computional Environments

Comprehensive computational reproducibility of study results requires full
capture of *all* analysis steps in a machine-executable form. This means that
for each and every output file we must know precisely from which inputs a
particular output was generated, and by which implementation of an algorithm.
Therefore we must capture not just the precise version of any input data file,
but additionally any custom code and software environment involved in a
computation.

DataLad is capable of providing this comprehensive capture by being able to
track source code in the same manner as (large) data files. Text files with
code are managed directly with [Git], while data file tracking and transport is
performed by [Git annex]. This includes image files of containerized
computational environments with all software needed to perform the desired
computations. Via the mechanism of a [Git submodule] DataLad can connect two or
more datasets.  This connection enables lightweight version tracking of the
entire content of a *sub*-dataset, without duplicating information or storage
demands.  Moreover, DataLad can transparently obtain subdataset content without
requiring a user to maintain a copy of the directory structure of a subdataset.

![ReproIn Convention](../fig/yoda-schemata-1.png)

The figure above shows a schematic depiction of this comprehensive tracking.
The dataset on the right tracks the state of three other dataset with input
data. From those DataLad can automatically obtain any required input files for
a computation which is implemented in code that is also tracked in this
dataset. This code is executed by DataLad in a computational environment that
is also tracked in the same dataset in the form of a container image file. From
this comprehensive set of inputs the outputs are computed, and are also
captured by DataLad in the same dataset.

In this lesson we will create two such datasets that represent two major
components of any imaging study: 1) data conversion from raw DICOM format, and
2) data analysis for answering a specific research question. While the involved
data files, code, computational environments will differ between these steps,
the overall principle of comprehensive input and output capture is a common
aspects shared between the two.

### Modular Study Components

Imaging studies tend to involve rather complex, multi-step analyses. It is
common that a single dataset is analyzed in multiple ways that in turn require
different types of preprocessing. Accurate presentation of methods and results
in a publication a precise understanding what exactly was done to which variant
of data to produce a particular result. However, it can be very challenging to
maintain this kind of awareness, especially in long-running projects that
involve multiple researchers or even groups with non-overlapping
responsibilities.

With DataLad's dataset-subdataset linkage it is fairly straightforward to
structure data processing in a study in modular units that enable standalone
publication of intermediate steps and effortless re-use of (carefully
validated) computational results.

![ReproIn Convention](../fig/yoda-schemata-2.png)

The above figure depicts a typical structure of data processing in an imaging
study, going from acquired raw data, to a converted and standardized form, to
preprocessed data, to one or more analysis implementations, to the respective
publications. Key aspect here is that each of these steps is represented by a
DataLad dataset that comprehensively tracks all inputs and outputs of a given
step using the features described in the previous section. Each dataset can in
turn be input to one or more additional data processing steps. While a single
dataset only tracks its immediate inputs, DataLad is capable of resolving any
input dependencies recursively across all subdataset levels (subdatasets of
subdatasets of ...). This makes it possible to discover the precise identity of
data, code, and computational environments for *any* underlying computation --
even years after a study was completed (given that each involved dataset was
archived). Each modular component only has to be archived once, because it
captures all states of its own evolution.

The two datasets created in this lesson represent two of those modular
components: 1) imaging data in a standardized (BIDS) format, and 2) the outputs
of an analysis (that includes a preprocessing step), where the second component
is built atop the first component using its outputs as inputs for an analysis.

### Facilitate Data Structure Standardization

Our analysis will benefit from a standardization effort that was performed at
the time of data acquisition. The metadata of the input DICOM images already
contain all necessary information to identify the purpose of individual scans
and encode essential properties into the filenames used in a BIDS-compliant
dataset. The following figure illustrates how this critical information can be
encoded into the acquisition protocol names at a scanner console when setting
up a new study, by following the [ReproIn] naming conventions.

[![ReproIn Convention](../fig/dbic-conversions.png)](https://github.com/repronim/reproin#overall-workflow)

## Prepare the Data for Analysis

Before analyzing imaging data, we typically have to convert them from their
original DICOM format into NIfTI files.

The data we are working with already follows the [ReproIn] naming conventions,
and the [HeuDiConv] converter can use this information to automatically create
a BIDS-compliant dataset for us.

We gain a lot here by adopting the [BIDS] standard. Up front, it saves us the
effort of creating an ad-hoc directory structure. But more importantly, by
structuring our data in a standard way (and an increasingly common one), it
opens up possibilities for us to easily feed our dataset into existing analysis
pipelines and tools.

Our first goal is to convert our DICOM data into a DataLad dataset in BIDS
format.

> ## Task: Create a new DataLad dataset called `localizer_scans`
>
> Use the [datalad create] command
>
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > % datalad create localizer_scans
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> {: .solution}
>
{: .challenge}

We now have the new dataset in the `localizer_scans/` directory. We will change
into this directory so that all further commands will be able to use relative
paths.

> ~~~
> % cd localizer_scans
> ~~~
> {: .bash}

> #### Advantages of Relative Path Specification
>
> In many cases, it does not matter whether one uses absolute vs relative paths,
> but when it comes to portability, it has a great impact. Using relative paths
> makes it possible to move a dataset to another folder on your system (or give
> it to a colleague using a different computer) and still have everything
> intra-connected and working as it should.
>
> {:callout}

When using DataLad, it is best to always run scripts from the root directory of
the dataset â€” and also code all scripts to use paths that are relative to this
root directory. For this to work, a dataset must contain all of the inputs of a
processing step (all code, all data).

That means that we should add the raw DICOM files to our dataset. In our case,
these DICOMs are already available in a DataLad dataset from
[GitHub](https://github.com/datalad/example-dicom-functional.git) that we can
add as a *subdataset* to our `localizer_scans` dataset.

> ## Task: Add DICOM data as a subdataset in `inputs/rawdata`
>

{: .challenge}

### Working With Containers

Any software you are using (and at any step) has the potential to have
bugs/errors/horrifying-gremlins â€” and arguably already does, you just may not
know it yet. Hence we take extra care to know *exactly* what software we are
using and that we can go back to it at a later stage, should we have the need to
investigate an issue.

Containerized computational environments are a great way to handle this problem.
DataLad (via its [datalad-container] extension) provides support for using and
managing such environments for data processing. We can add an image of a
computational environment to a DataLad dataset (just like any other) file, so we
know exactly what we are using and where to get it again in the future.

A ready-made [singularity] container with the [HeuDiConv] DICOM converter
(~160 MB) is available from [singularity-hub] at:
shub://ReproNim/ohbm2018-training:heudiconvn (a local copy is available at
`~/images/heudiconv.simg` in the training VM).

> ## Task: Add the HeuDiConv container to the dataset
>
> Use the [datalad containers-add] command to add this container under the name
> `heudiconv`. Then use the [datalad containers-list] command to verify that
> everything worked.
>
> > ## Solution

> > % # regular call
> > % # datalad containers-add heudiconv --url shub://ReproNim/ohbm2018-training:heudiconvn
> > % # BUT in the training VM do this to save on downloads
> > % datalad containers-add heudiconv --url ~/images/heudiconv.simg \
> >       --call-fmt 'singularity exec {img} {cmd}'
> > % datalad containers-list
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> {: .solution}
>
{: .challenge}

Our dataset now tracks all input data and the computational environment for the
DICOM conversion. This means that we have a complete record of all components
(thus far) in this one dataset that we can reference via relative paths from the
dataset root. This is a good starting point for conducting a portable analysis.

[datalad run] and [datalad containers-run] \(provided by the [datalad-container]
extension) allow a user to run arbitrary shell commands and capture the output
in a dataset. By design, both commands behave nearly identically. The primary
difference is that [datalad run] executes commands in the local environment,
whereas [datalad containers-run] executes commands inside of a containerized
environment. Here, we will use the latter.

> ## Task: Convert DICOM using HeuDiConv from the container
>
> An appropriate [HeuDiConv] command looks like this:

>     heudiconv -f reproin -s 02 -c dcm2niix -b -l "" --minmeta -a . \
>         -o /tmp/heudiconv.sub-02 --files inputs/rawdata/dicoms
>
> It essentially tells it to use the [ReproIn heuristic] to convert the

You can now confirm that a NIfTI file has been added to the dataset and that its
name is compliant with the [BIDS] standard. Information such as the task-label
has been automatically extracted from the imaging sequence description.

There is only one thing missing before we can analyze our functional
imaging data: we need to know what stimulation was done at which point during
the scan. Thankfully, the data was collected using an implementation that
exported this information directly in the [BIDS] `events.tsv` format. The
file came with our DICOM dataset and can be found at
`inputs/rawdata/events.tsv`. All we need to do is copy it to the right location
under the BIDS-mandated name.

We can use `cp` to do this easily, but the copying step itself would not be
entered into the dataset's history and thus the file would be added with no
indication of where it came from. A good commit message can help with that, but
what would be even better is to run `cp` using [datalad run] to capture this
information.

> ## Task: Copy the event.tsv file to its correct location via `run`
>
> BIDS requires that this file be located at `sub-02/func/sub-02_task-oneback_run-01_events.tsv`.
> Use the [datalad run] command to execute the `cp` command to implement this
> step. This time, however, use the options `--input` and
> `--output` to inform [datalad run] what files need to be available
> and what locations need to be writeable for this command.

We are now done with the data preparation. We have the skeleton of a
BIDS-compliant dataset that contains all data in the right format and using the
correct file names. In addition, the computational environment used to perform
the DICOM conversion is tracked, as well as a separate dataset with the input
DICOM data. This means we can trace every single file in this dataset back to
its origin, including the commands and inputs used to create it.

This dataset is now ready. It can be archived and used as input for one or more
analyses of any kind. Let's leave the dataset directory now:
